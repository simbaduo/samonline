The website for Swander’s Automotive will have a landing page with a header and footer that will remain static on every page. There will be a photo carousel underneath header nav bar. There will be multiple static pages of information with real content to increase search engine optimization. There will be a dynamic "Specials" page changing frequently, as well as two form submit pages -- 1. veteran’s page and 2. Schedule appointment page.

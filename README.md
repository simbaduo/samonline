The website for Swander’s Automotive will have a landing page with a header and footer that will remain static on every page. There will be a photo carousel underneath header nav bar. There will be many static pages of information with real content to increase search engine optimization. There will be specials regularly changing, as well as 2 form submits on the veteran’s page and the schedule appointment page.

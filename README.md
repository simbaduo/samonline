# Swander's Automotive

This is a webpage built for a well-established running business. The client was unable to modify inventory or schedule appointments efficiently and affordably. I created 2 separate projects to solve these problems. When a user schedules an appointment, an alert and e-mail is sent to the scheduling team, and if either of the requested appointments are confirmed, a reply e-mail is automatically sent back to the customer using SendGrid API E-mail service. Administration can also add new vehicles to be displayed on the homepage in live time.

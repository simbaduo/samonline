# Swander's Automotive

![Swander's Auto Homepage Preview](src/images/sampreview.png)


This webpage was built for a well-established running business. With previous systems, the client was unable to modify inventory or schedule appointments efficiently and affordably. I created 2 separate projects to solve these problems. I designed an interface where a user can schedule an appointment and an alert/e-mail is sent to the scheduling team. If either appointment can be confirmed, a reply e-mail is automatically sent back to the customer using SendGrid API E-mail service. Administration can also add new vehicles to be displayed on the homepage in live time.

Technologies Used: React JS, CSS, HTML5 --- C#, .NET Core, ASP.NET Core, SQL, PostgreSQL
